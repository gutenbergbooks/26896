<h3>COULD SHAKESPEARE HAVE DESIGNATED CLEOPATRA
"YOND RIBALD-RID NAG OF EGYPT?"</h3>

  <p>To judge of this question fairly, it will be necessary to cite the
  passage in which it occurs, as it stands in the folio, Act III. Sc. 8.,
  somewhat at large.</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"<i>Eno.</i> Naught, naught, all naught! I can behold no longer;</p>
      <p>Th' Antoniad, the Egyptian admiral,</p>
      <p>With all their sixty, fly, and turn the rudder;</p>
      <p>To see't, mine eyes are blasted.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="stanza">
      <p><i>Enter</i> <span class="sc">Scarus</span>.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="stanza">
      <p><i>Scar.</i> Gods and goddesses, all the whole synod of them!</p>
    </div>

    <div class="stanza">
      <p><i>Eno.</i> What's the passion?</p>
    </div>

    <div class="stanza">
      <p><i>Scar.</i> The greater cantle of the world is lost</p>
      <p>With very ignorance; we have kiss'd away</p>
      <p>Kingdoms and provinces.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="stanza">
      <p><i>Eno.</i> How appears the fight?</p>
    </div>

    <div class="stanza">
      <p><i>Scar.</i> On our side like the token'd pestilence,</p>
      <p>Where death is sure. Yond <i>ribaudred Nagge</i> of Egypt,</p>
      <p>Whom leprosy o'ertake, i' the midst o' the fight</p>
      <p>When vantage like a pair of twins appear'd,</p>
      <p>Both as the same, or rather ours the elder,</p>
      <p>The Breeze upon her, like a cow in June,</p>
      <p>Hoists sail and flies.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="stanza">
      <p><i>Eno.</i> That I beheld:</p>
      <p>Mine eyes did sicken at the sight, and could not</p>
      <p>Endure a further view.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="stanza">
      <p><i>Scar.</i> She once being loof'd,</p>
      <p>The noble ruin of her magick, Antony,</p>
      <p>Claps on his sea-wing, and, like a doting mallard,</p>
      <p>Leaving the fight in height, flies after her;</p>
      <p>I never saw an action of such shame;</p>
      <p>Experience, manhood, honour, ne'er before</p>
      <p>Did violate so itself.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="stanza">
      <p><i>Eno.</i> Alack, alack!"</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>The notes in the variorum edition begin by one from Johnson, in which
  he says:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"The word is in the old edition <i>ribaudred</i>, which I do not
  understand, but mention it in hopes that others may raise some happy
  conjecture."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>Then Steevens, after having told us that a <i>ribald</i> is a <i>lewd
  fellow</i>, says:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"<i>Ribaudred</i>, the old reading, is I believe no more than a
  corruption. Shakspeare, who is not always very nice about his
  versification, might have written,</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg1">'Yon <i>ribald-rid</i> nag of Egypt'&mdash;</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p><i>i.e.</i> Yon strumpet, who is common to every wanton fellow."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>Malone approves Steevens's <i>ribald-rid</i>, but adds,</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"By <i>ribald</i>, Scarus, I think, means the lewd Antony in
  particular, not <i>every</i> lewd fellow."</p>

</blockquote>

<p><!-- Page 274 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page274"></a>{274}</span></p>

  <p>Tyrwhitt saw the necessity of reading <i>hag</i> instead of
  <i>nag</i>, and says what follows seems to prove it:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="i6hg3">"She once being loof'd,</p>
      <p>The noble ruin of her magick, Antony,</p>
      <p>Claps on his sea-wing."</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>It is obvious that the poet would not have made Scarus speak of Antony
  as the noble ruin of Cleopatra's magick, and of his manhood and honour,
  and in the same breath designate him as a ribald. He would be much more
  likely to apply the epithet <i>lewd hag</i> to such an enchantress as
  Cleopatra, than that of <i>ribald-rid nag</i>, which I feel convinced
  never entered the imagination of the poet.</p>

  <p>Imperfect acquaintance with our older language has been too frequently
  the weak point of the commentators; and we see here our eminent
  lexicographer confessing his ignorance of a word which the dictionaries
  of the poet's age would have enabled him readily to explain. For although
  we have not the participle <i>ribaudred</i>, which may be peculiar to the
  poet, in Baret's <i>Alvearie</i> we find "<i>Ribaudrie</i>, vilanie in
  actes or wordes, filthiness, uncleanness"&mdash;"A <i>ribaudrous</i> and
  filthie tongue, os obsc&oelig;num et impudicum:" in Minsheu,
  <i>ribaudrie</i> and <i>ribauldrie</i>, which is the prevailing
  orthography of the word, and indicates its sound and derivation from the
  French, rather than from the Italian <i>ribalderia</i>.</p>

  <p>That <i>nagge</i> is a misprint for <i>hagge</i>, will be evident from
  the circumstance, that in the first folio we have a similar error in the
  <i>Merry Wives of Windsor</i>, Act IV. Sc. 2., where instead of "you
  witch, you <i>hagge</i>," it is misprinted "you witch, you <i>ragge</i>."
  It is observable that <i>hagge</i> is the form in which the word is most
  frequently found in the folios, and it is the epithet the poet applies to
  a witch or enchantress.</p>

  <p>I cannot, therefore, but consider the alteration of the text by
  Steevens as one of the most violent and uncalled-for innovations of which
  he has been guilty; and he himself seems to have had his misgivings, for
  his observation that Shakspeare "is not always very nice about his
  versification" was meant as an apology for marring its harmony by the
  substitution of <i>ribald-rid</i> for the poet's own
  <i>ribaudred</i>.</p>

  <p>It is to me a matter of surprise that Mr. Collier and Mr. Knight, in
  their laudable zeal for adherence as closely as possible to the old

<h3>BROWNE'S BRITANNIA'S PASTORALS.</h3>

  <p>I have lately been amusing myself by reading the small volume with
  this title published in Clarke's <i>Cabinet Series</i>, 1845.</p>

  <p>Among the many pleasing passages that I met with in its pages,
  <i>two</i> in particular struck me as being remarkable for their beauty;
  but I find that neither of them is cited by either Ellis or Campbell.
  (See Ellis, <i>Specimens of the Early English Poets</i>, 4th edition,
  corrected, 1811; and the Campbell, <i>Specimens of the British Poets</i>,
  1819.)</p>

  <p>Indeed Campbell says of Browne:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"His poetry is not without beauty; but it is the beauty of mere
  landscape and allegory, without the manners and passions that constitute
  human interest."&mdash;Vol. iii. p. 323.</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>Qualified by some such expression as&mdash;<i>too
  often&mdash;generally&mdash;in almost every instance</i>,&mdash;the last
  clause might have passed,&mdash;standing as it does, it appears to me to
  give anything but a fair idea of the poetry of the <i>Pastorals</i>. My
  two favourites are the "Description of Night"&mdash;</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"Now great Hyperion left his golden throne," &amp;c.,</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>(consisting of twenty-six lines)&mdash;book ii. song 1. (Clarke, p.
  186.) and the "Lament of the Little Shepherd for his friend
  Philocel"&mdash;</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"With that the little shepherd left his task," &amp;c.,</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>(forty-four lines)&mdash;book ii. song 4. (Clarke, p. 278.)</p>

  <p>If you will allow me to quote a short extract from each passage, it
  may enable the reader to see how far I am justified in protesting against
  Campbell's criticism; and I will then try to support the pretensions of
  the last, by showing that much of the very same imagery that it contains
  is to be found in other writings of acknowledged merit:&mdash;</p>

  <p>Both these passages may have been quoted by some of Campbell's
  predecessors. This might justify him in not repeating them, but
  <i>not</i> in writing the criticism to which I have ventured to object.
  His work holds a high rank in English literature&mdash;it is taken as a
  text-book by <i>the generality of readers</i>; for which reasons I think
  that every dictum it lays down ought to be examined with more than usual
  care and attention.</p>

  <p>"The morning of the day on which the farmer was to be buried, was
  rendered remarkable by the uncommon denseness of an autumnal fog. To Mrs.

  gradually yielded to the influence of the sun, and slowly retiring from
  the valley, hung, as if rolled into masses, mid-way upon the mountains,
  did the changes thus produced excite any admiration. Still, wherever she
  looked, all seemed to wear the aspect of sadness. As she passed from
  Morrison's to the house of mourning, the shocks of yellow corn, spangled
  with dewdrops, appeared to her to stand as mementos of the vanity of
  human hopes, and the inutility of human labours. The cattle, as they went
  forth to pasture, lowing as they went, seemed as if lamenting that the

  <p><i>Anecdotes of Old Times</i> (Vol. iii., p. 143.).&mdash;A friend of
  mine has furnished me with the following particulars, which may, perhaps,
  be interesting to A.&nbsp;A.</p>

  <p>When the aunt of my friend married and began housekeeping, there were
  only two tea-kettles besides her own in the town of Knighton,
  Radnorshire. The clergyman of the parish forbad the use of tea in his
  family; but his sister kept a small tea service in the drawer of the
  table by which she sat at work in the afternoon, and secretly made
  herself a cup of tea at four o'clock, gently closing the drawer if she
  heard her brother approach. This clergyman's daughter died, at an
  advanced age, in 1850.</p>

  <p>My friend's mother (who was born a year or two before the battle of
  Culloden), having occasion to visit London while living at Ludlow, went
  by the waggon, at that time the only public conveyance on that road. A
  friend of her's wished to place her daughter at a school in Worcester,
  and as she kept no carriage, and was unable to ride on horseback, then
  the usual mode of travelling, she <i>walked</i> from her residence in
  Knighton to Ludlow, and thence to Worcester, accompanied by her daughter,
  who rode at a gentle pace beside her.</p>

  <i>Mercurius Aulicus</i>, the Court Gazette; Needham, of a Parliamentary

  <p><i>Honeymoon.</i>&mdash;Among my memoranda I find that, on January 31,
  1845, an accomplished Welsh lady said to me, that the common expression
  "Honeymoon" was "probably derived from the old practice in Wales of
  drinking <i>methèglin</i> for thirty days after the marriage of a bride
  and bridegroom. A <i>methèglin</i> jollification for thirty days among
  the relatives and friends of the newly married pair." The
  <i>methèglin</i> is a fermented liquor, of some potency, made from honey.
  The lady asked me, at the same time, if <i>honey</i> was used by the
  ancient Greeks or Romans in the preparation of a fermented liquor. I said
  that I recollected no such use of honey among them, but that the ancient
  Greeks seemed to have brewed a <i>beer</i> of some kind from barley or
  other grain, as allusion was made to it by Aristophanes. Perhaps this
  notice of the "honeymoon" may draw forth some information from your
  correspondents who are learned in "folk lore." In the Old Testament there
  are many passages alluding to the use of honey, but none of them appear
  to indicate its having been employed in making a fermented beverage.
  Lucretius alludes to the practice of enticing children to swallow
  disagreeable medicine by anointing the edge of the cup with honey.</p>

  <p>"By the Romans maple wood, when knotted and veined, was highly prized

  on pearls, jewels, or similar costly trifles, she used to retort, and

<h3>AUTHORS OF THE ROLLIAD&mdash;PURSUITS OF
LITERATURE.</h3>

  <p>I cannot doubt but that many of your readers feel with me under great
  obligations to your very able and obliging correspondents, <span
  class="sc">Lord Braybrooke</span> and <span class="sc">Mr.
  Markland</span>, for the information afforded us upon the subject of the
  writers of the Rolliad. And, though not many of them are, probably,
  sufficiently old to remember as I do&mdash;if not the actual publication
  of that work, yet, at least, the excitement produced by its
  appearance&mdash;I apprehend that the greater number are aware that it
  really did produce a great sensation; and that, as with the <i>Letters of
  Junius</i> before it, and the <i>Pursuits of Literature</i> subsequently,
  public curiosity for a long time busied itself in every direction to
  detect the able and daring authors. With this impression, I have been not
  a little surprised to find, since the notice of the work in your pages,
  that I have failed in tracing any account of it in the two books to which
  I naturally turned, the <i>Gentleman's Magazine</i> and Nichols'
  <i>Literary Anecdotes</i>. Very thankful therefore should I be if any of
  our correspondents would direct my inquiries to a better channel, and
  particularly if they would guide me to information respecting the
  authors,&mdash;for here I am completely at fault. I allude more
  especially to Richardson, Tickell, and General Fitzpatrick; who, I doubt
  not, were men of such notoriety and standing in their day, that "not to
  know them, argues myself unknown." And yet, humiliating as is this
  acknowledgment, it is far better to make it than to remain in ignorance;
  for the case can surely not be one "where ignorance is bliss," and where,
  consequently, "'tis folly to be wise."</p>

  <p>I need hardly beg it to be understood, that, in grouping together the
  <i>Rolliad</i>, the <i>Pursuits of Literature</i>, and <i>Junius'
  Letters</i>, I by no means intended to place them upon an equality; and
  here I may inform your correspondent S.&nbsp;T.&nbsp;D. (what a pity that you do
  not require every one to give his name at length!) that the fact of Mr.
  Matthias being the author of the second of these works was scarcely made
  a secret by his family after he went to Italy. Indeed, for some time
  previously, it was well known to myself from what passed at this house,
  where he was a frequent visitor, and where I should at any time be happy
  to give S.&nbsp;T.&nbsp;D. ocular demonstration of it, by the production of the
  letters addressed to the <!-- Page 277 --><span class="pagenum"><a

<h3>ACCOUNT OF A LARGE ANCIENT WOOD-ENGRAVING.</h3>

  <p>Perhaps some of your readers may be able to give me information
  regarding a large and very elaborate woodcut, which has been many years
  in my possession, and obviously has been used as the fly-leaf of some
  folio volume, though, of course not originally intended for such a
  purpose. It is so complicated, that I fear I shall have some difficulty
  in explaining it, and my explanation may require more space than you may
  be willing to afford me. You can, however, insert my Query at any time
  when you have room to spare.</p>

  <p>The size of the engraving, is 16 inches by 13, and it is divided into
  two large oblong circles, and a centre; a story being carried on, clearly
  allegorically, from the outer circle to the second, and from the second
  to the centre. I will speak of each, beginning with the outer, which is
  entered by a portico, consisting of two columns and a round arch; on the
  base of one of the columns is a monogran of the artist or of the
  engraver, formed of the letters R.&nbsp;D. Under the arch is seated a lady
  richly attired, who holds a large cup and cover in her left hand, and
  around her are fourteen naked children, to one of which she seems
  tendering the chalice; while a bearded old man, with a scroll, is
  directing attention to what is going on in the outer circle. Passing
  under this portico we see, immediately behind it, six ladies, three
  religious and three secular; while to the right of the three secular
  ladies is a naked, winged female figure, with her foot on a sphere, a
  large goblet in her right hand, and some objects that look like fetters
  in her left hand. To the right of this figure are many others of both
  sexes, but nearer the spectator, some tranquil and some in despair;
  while, within a sort of pavilion, we see a young lady and an old
  gentleman banquetting, and in another compartment in bed. Still farther
  to the right of the winged figure are persons who appear to be escaping
  from torments, while a young man in rags is making his way towards a
  person in a religious habit, who has a scourge in his hand; behind these
  are two persons under a miserable thatched shed, while a lady is pointing
  out to a young man what is to be observed in the second circle.</p>

  <p>This division is entered by another gate consisting of two square
  ornamental columns supporting a low gable, beneath which a lady, with a
  cross on the cape of her dress, is receiving a young man. The persons in
  this circle are very variously employed: on the right of the spectator
  are rocks with one man climbing up them, and another fallen headlong: on
  the left are five persons, male and female, engaged in singing and
  playing, and near them two men performing military music on a drum and
  fife; to their right are groups of philosophers and men of science with
  spheres, astrolabes, books, compasses, &amp;c., and one wearing a laurel
  crown with a scroll in his hand, probably a poet.</p>

  <p>We then come to the centre, or inner circle, which is entered by a
  wooden gate of the simplest construction, and under it is a religious
  lady with a young erect female on her right hand, and a supplicating
  male, in tattered garments, on her left. Beyond these are six females,
  variously clad, some with flowing hair, some in close caps, and others
  with <i>nebulæ</i> round their heads. A little to the right of these is a
  throned lady, with a crown of peculiar construction on her head, and a
  sceptre in her hand, before whom kneels a female figure, upon whose brows
  the throned lady is about to place a coronet. Behind the throne is what
  appears to be a conventual building of rather singular appearance, with
  round, square, and octagon towers, and surrounded by a battlemented wall.
  Considerably to the right of the throned lady is a figure clearly
  intended for some booted king wearing a crown and a collar of esses: on
  one side of him is a severe looking dame, fully clad and with flowing
  hair; and on the other a younger lady, also with flowing hair, and with
  her bosom bare.</p>

  <p>Such is the woodcut regarding which I request some intelligence from
  your readers, as I have shown it to several persons, who I thought could
  enlighten me, but who could afford me no satisfaction. I suspect, from
  the costumes and the edificies, that it is German; and I ought to have
  mentioned that each circle is separated from the others by a low stone
  wall running all around, and that trees, hills, and fountains are not
  sparingly introduced. In the whole, it includes nearly a hundred figures
  of men, women, and children.</p>

  <p>Is it possible that this is the identical Anthony, third surviving son
  of Sir John Bridges, first Baron Chandos of Sudeley, respecting whose
  fate there is so much uncertainty? He is presumed to have married a
  daughter of Fortescue of Essex, but the collateral evidence on which the
  supposition is founded is too slight to be satisfactory. Little is known
  but that he was born before 1532; that he was living in 1584 (in which
  year he was presented to the living of Meysey Hampton in Gloucestershire,
  the county in which he resided); and that he had a son Robert, upon a
  presumed descent from whom the late Sir Egerton Brydges founded his
  well-known claim to the barony of Chandos of Sudeley.</p>

<h3>THOMAS MAY.</h3>

<p class="cenhead">(Vol. iii., p. 167.)</p>

  <p>Thomas May, famous amongst the busy characters of his age, both as a
  politician and a poet, was the eldest son of Sir Thos. May, Knt., of
  Mayfield, in Sussex, where he was born in 1595. At the usual period of
  life, he was admitted a fellow-commoner of Sidney Sussex College,
  Cambridge; and having taken the degree of B.A. he entered himself at
  Gray's Inn, with the intention of studying the law, which, however, it is
  uncertain whether he ever pursued as a profession. Whilst he was a
  student of the law, he made the acquaintance of Edward Hyde, afterwards
  Earl of Clarendon; and became the intimate associate of Ben Jonson,
  Selden, Cotton, Sir K. Digby, Thos. Carew<a name="footnotetag1"
  href="#footnote1"><sup>[1]</sup></a>, "and some others of eminent
  faculties in their several ways."</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"His parts of nature and art," writes Clarendon<a name="footnotetag2"
  href="#footnote2"><sup>[2]</sup></a>, in describing his character, "were
  very good, as appears by his translation of Lucan (none of the easiest
  work of that kind), and more by his Supplement to Lucan, which being
  entirely his own, for the learning, the wit, and the language, may be
  well looked upon as one of the best epic poems in the English
  language."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>As an elegant writer, indeed, of Latin verse, he is justly numbered
  amongst the most successful of the accomplished poets of our
  nation&mdash;Ben Jonson, Cowley, Milton, Marvell, Crashaw, Addison, Gray,
  Smart, T. Warton, Sir W. Jones, &amp;c.&mdash;who have devoted their
  leisure to this species of composition. Clarendon goes on to say that May
  was "born to a fortune, if his father had not spent it; so that he had
  only an annuity left him, not proportionable to a liberal education:"</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"Yet since," continues this illustrious authority, "his fortune could
  not raise his mind, he brought his mind down to his fortune, by a great
  modesty and humility in his nature, which was not affected, but very well
  became an imperfection in his speech, which was a great mortification to
  him, and kept him from entering upon any discourse but in the company of
  his very friends," of whom he had not a few, for "he was cherished by
  many persons of honour, and very acceptable in all places."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>From Charles I., no mean judge of poetry, and a liberal patron of the
  Muses, May received much encouragement, and many substantial marks of
  favour in the shape of donatives; and it was at the express command of
  this monarch that he wrote his historical poem entitled <i>The Victorious
  Reigne of Edward III.</i> From disgust, however, at the appointment of
  D'Avenant to the Laureateship, on the death of Jonson in 1637,&mdash;a
  post to which, according to what he considered to be his own superior
  deserts<a name="footnotetag3" href="#footnote3"><sup>[3]</sup></a>, he
  was himself justly entitled,&mdash;"May fell from his duty, and all his
  former friends," and became an active agent in promoting the designs of
  the so-called popular leaders. Through the interest of Cromwell, he was
  nominated Secretary to the Parliament, in which capacity he wrote a
  History of its transactions, a work which was published in 1647. This
  performance, which is highly commended by Granger, rendered its author
  extremely obnoxious to the royal party, who exercised all their powers of
  pen to disparage both the book and its compiler. He is represented by
  Clarendon, for instance, "as prostituting himself to the vile office of
  celebrating the infamous acts of those who were in rebellion against the
  king; which he did so meanly, that he seemed to all men to have lost his
  wits, when he left his honesty." Anthony à Wood's account<a
  name="footnotetag4" href="#footnote4"><sup>[4]</sup></a> of these
  matters, and of May himself, is that</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"He was graciously countenanced by K. Charles I. and his royal
  consort; but he, finding not that preferment from either which he
  expected, grew discontented, sided with the Presbyterians, and, upon the
  <!-- Page 280 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page280"></a>{280}</span>turn of the times, became a debauchee
  <i>ad omnia</i>; entertained ill principles as to religion, spoke often
  very slightly of the Trinity, kept beastly and atheistical company, of
  whom Thos. Challoner, the regicide, was one, and endeavoured to his power
  to asperse and invalidate the king and his cause."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>His acquaintance with Challoner is also alluded to by Aubrey who
  says<a name="footnotetag5" href="#footnote5"><sup>[5]</sup></a>, "that
  his translation of Lucan's excellent poem, made him in love with the
  republique." Aubrey adds, he was&mdash;</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"A handsome man, debauched, and lodged in the little square by Cannon
  Row, as you go through the alley."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>Clarendon concludes his notice of May by observing that&mdash;</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"Shortly after the publication of his parliamentary history he died,
  miserable and neglected, and deserves to be forgotten."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>The fact is, he was found dead in his bed in Nov. 1650; but that he
  was "neglected" is not altogether correct. At any rate, he was honoured
  with a public funeral, a marble monument, and a laudatory epitaph in
  Westminster Abbey,&mdash;short-lived dignities! for, at the Restoration,
  the memorial of his fame was torn down, whilst his body was exhumed, and,
  after being treated with much ignominy, hurled into a large pit in St.
  Margaret's churchyard adjoining.&mdash;Besides the works above noticed,
  May also wrote <i>The Description of Henry II.</i>, in verse, with <i>A
  Short Survey of the Changes of his Reign</i>, and <i>The Single and
  Comparative Character of Henry and Richard his Sons</i>, in prose. Nor
  was that of Lucan his only translation, for he rendered into English
  verse <i>Virgil's Georgics</i> and <i>Selected Epigrams of Martial</i>.
  He was also the author of five dramas, two of which are given in
  Dodsley's <i>Old Plays</i>. A now forgotten critic, Henry Headley, B.A.,
  of Norwich, observes concerning his historical poetics, that
  May&mdash;</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"Has caught no small portion of the energy and declamatory spirit
  which characterises the Roman poet, whom, as he translated, he insensibly
  made his model. His battle pieces," our critic continues, "highly merit
  being brought forward to notice; they possess the requisites, in a
  remarkable degree, for interesting the feelings of an Englishman. While
  in accuracy they vie with a gazette, they are managed with such
  dexterity, as to busy the mind with unceasing agitation, with scenes
  highly diversified and impassioned by striking character, minute
  incident, and alarming situation."<a name="footnotetag6"
  href="#footnote6"><sup>[6]</sup></a></p>

</blockquote>

  <p>In confirmation of the general propriety and justness of these
  remarks, I would refer to the description of "The Den of the Vices" (H.
  <span class="scac">II</span>. b. i.), and to the accounts of "The Death
  of Rosamond" (H. <span class="scac">II</span>. b. v.), "The Battle of
  Cressy" (E. <span class="scac">III</span>. b. iii.), and "The Capture of
  Mortimer" (E. <span class="scac">III</span>. b. i.). These pieces can
  only be thus vindicated, being much too long for extracting; but I think
  a republication of the entire poems would be an acceptable boon to the
  public.</p>

  <p><i>Thomas May, the author of the Supplement to Lucan</i> (Vol. iii.,
  p. 167), was the secretary and historian of the Long Parliament. He was
  born at Mayfield in 1595; took the degree of B.A. at Sydney-Sussex
  College, Cambridge, and afterwards entered Gray's Inn, but devoted
  himself to literature. He translated Virgil's <i>Georgics</i>, Selected
  Epigrams of Martial, and in 1627 Lucan's <i>Pharsalia</i>; to the latter,
  in 1630, he supplied an English continuation of his own in seven books;
  intituled, <i> A Continuation of the Subject of Lucan's Historical Poem
  till the Death of Julius Cæsar</i>. It was dedicated to Charles. He
  afterwards published at Leyden a Latin translation of the seven
  additional books; this was added to the Amsterdam and other editions of
  Lucan, and has established May's fame as a classic scholar. Andrew

  <p>was created Countess of Dorchester by James II., and subsequently
  married David Collyer, first Earl of Pontmore in Scotland. She died in
  1692, having had by King James a natural daughter, to whom, by royal
  warrant, that monarch gave the rank and precedence of a duke's daughter;
  she was styled Lady Catherine Darnley, and married first, in October
  1699, James, third Earl of Anglesey, from whom, on account of alleged
  cruelty on his part, she was separated by act of parliament in the
  following year. The earl died in 1701, and his widow married, secondly,
  in 1705, John Sheffield, first Duke of Normanby and Buckingham. She died
  on the 13th of March, 1743, and was interred with almost regal pomp in
  Westminster Abbey. By her <i>first</i> husband (the Earl of Anglesey) she
  had an only daughter, the Lady Catherine Annesley, married to Mr. William
  Phipps, father of the first Lord Mulgrave, and, consequently,
  great-grandfather of the present Marquis of Normanby, who on his recent
  elevation to that dignity, has, it appears, preferred to take one of the
  ducal titles of a nobleman from whom he does <i>not</i> descend, and of
  whose blood there does not flow a single drop in his veins, to the just
  assumption of the title of one from whom he <i>does</i> descend, and
  whose sole representative he undoubtedly is.</p>

  <p>Of the Duchess of Buckingham's inordinate pride, there are some
  curious stories in Walpole's Letters to Sir Horace Mann (<i>sub anno</i>
  1743). But perhaps the most remarkable instance of it is to be found in a
  periodical paper called the <i>British Champion</i>, which was published
  at that time, and which is now not commonly to be met. In the No. for
  April 7, 1743, there is the following anecdote:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"I have been informed that a lady of high rank, finding her end
  approaching, and feeling very uneasy apprehensions of this sort, came at
  length to a resolution of sending for a clergyman, of whom she had heard
  a very good character, in order to be satisfied as to some doubts. The
  first question she asked was whether in heaven (for she made no doubt of
  going thither) some respect would not be had to a woman of such birth and
  breeding? The good man, for such he really was, endeavoured to show her
  the weakness of this notion, and to convince her that there was, where
  she was going, no acceptance of persons, and much more to the same
  purpose. This the poor lady heard with much attention, and then said with
  a sigh, 'Well, if it be so, this heaven must be, after all, a strange
  sort of a place!'"</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>P. C. S. S. is unwilling to believe this painful story&mdash;the more
  so, as it must be recollected that the author of the paper was an
  inveterate Whig, and the Duchess (jure paterno) as inveterate a
  Jacobite.</p>

<h3>SAN GRAIL.</h3>

  <p>Sir Walter Scott, in his <i>Marmion</i> (Introduction to Canto First),
  writes of Sir Lancelot of the Lake, that&mdash;</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"A sinful man and unconfessed,</p>
      <p>He took the Sangreal's holy quest,</p>
      <p>And slumbering saw the vision high</p>
      <p>He might not view with waking eye."</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>In his note on this passage, he refers to the romance of the Morte
  Arthur, and says:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"One day when Arthur was holding a high feast with his Knights of the
  Round Table, the Sangreal, a vessel out of which the last Passover was
  eaten (a precious relic, which had long remained concealed from human
  eyes, because of the sins of the land), suddenly appeared to him and all
  his chivalry. The consequence of this vision was that all the knights
  took on them a solemn vow to seek the Sangreal."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>The orthography of the word in the romance itself is
  <i>Sancgreall</i>, which affords us a clue to what I believe to be its
  true etymology, <i>Sang réel</i> (Sanguis realis), a name it derived from
  the tradition of its having been employed, not only to hold the paschal
  lamb at the Last Supper, but also by Joseph of Arimathea to catch the
  blood and water which flowed from the wounds of our Blessed Lord.</p>

  <p>Archdeacon Nares, in his <i>Glossary</i>, pp. 209. 445., enters
  largely into the legendary history of the Sangreal, as well as the
  question of its orthography. He takes some pains to refute the etymology
  given above, and quotes Roquefort (<i>Dict. de la Langue Romane</i>) to
  prove that graal or <i>greal</i> signifies <i>a broad open dish</i>. Will
  any one who has the means of consulting Roquefort inform us, whether he
  brings forward any instance of the existence of such a word in this
  sense? or, if so employed, whether such use may not have arisen from the
  ordinary erroneous orthography? It is a question well worth
  investigation, which I hope may call some abler pens than mine into
  exercise.</p>

  <p>This holy relic, the object of so much fruitless search to Arthur and
  his knights, is now safely deposited in the cathedral of Genoa, where
  all, holy or unholy, may behold it, on making the accustomed offering to
  its sanctity. Of old, it concealed itself from the eyes of all but those
  free from mortal sin; but now, the ability to pay five francs puts one in
  possession of every Christian virtue, and the <i>Sacro Catino</i> (as it
  is called) is exhibited on the payment of that sum. In addition to the
  authorities quoted by Nares, I would refer to Sir F. Palgrave, in
  <i>Murray's Handbook to Northern Italy</i>, 1st edition, p. 105.</p>

<h3>BAB AT THE BOWSTER.</h3>

<p class="cenhead">(Vol. ii., p. 517.)</p>

  <p>Your correspondent <span class="sc">Mac</span> is mistaken when he
  says that no words are used in the Scottish dance of "Bab at the
  Bowster:" I have myself "babbed at the Bowster" within the last few
  years. Upon that occasion the words sung by the company while dancing
  round the individual bearing the "bowster" were&mdash;</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"Wha learn'd you to dance,</p>
      <p class="i1">You to dance, you to dance,</p>
      <p>Wha learn'd you to dance</p>
      <p class="i1">Bab at the bowster brawly?"</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>To which the "bowster-bearer" replies&mdash;</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"My mither learned me to dance,</p>
      <p class="i1">Me to dance, me to dance,</p>
      <p>My mither learned me to dance</p>
      <p class="i1">Bab at the bowster brawly."</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>After which, throwing down the "bowster" or cushion before one of the
  opposite sex, they both kneel upon it, and kiss one another
  <i>affectionately</i>.</p>

  <p>I never heard any words save the above; but a friend from a
  neighbouring county (Dumbartonshire) informs me, that with them it is
  sometimes changed into</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"Wha gi'ed you the keys to keep,</p>
      <p class="i1">The keys to keep," &amp;c.</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>There are also other variations which I believe I can procure, should
  they be desired by <span class="sc">Mac</span> or others. I should
  perhaps mention, for the benefit of Southrons, that almost all
  untravelled Scotchmen in conversation use the verb <i>to learn</i> in
  place of the verb <i>to teach</i>.</p>

  <p>The dance in Scotland called "Bab at the Bowster" is always the
  winding up at "kirns" and other merrymakings, and is most likely similar
  to the cushion-dance. The tune to which it is danced has words belonging
  to it. The beginning lines are&mdash;</p>

<h3>OLIVER CROMWELL AND HIS DEALINGS WITH THE DEVIL.</h3>

<p class="cenhead">(Vol. iii., p. 207.)</p>

  <p>Among the papers of an old personal friend and correspondent of the
  "Sylvanus Urban" of his day,&mdash;a clergyman of the good old school,
  who died a quarter of a century ago, aged eighty-six, I find the
  inclosed. It may possibly lead to the further elucidation of one of the
  Notes of B.&nbsp;B. It is unfortunate that no date is attached to it, nor any
  intimation of its history. Its owner was the intimate friend of Bennet,
  Bishop of Cloyne, of Dr. Farmer, of Burgess, Bishop of St. David's
  (afterwards Salisbury), and other eminent divines of his time.</p>

  <p>With this MS. was inclosed another, in more modern writing; but, from
  the orthography, copied from an older paper, headed "Private Amours of
  Oliver Cromwell." It is very short, and also without date. It is at your
  service if desired.</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"On y<sup>e</sup> 3d of Sept., in y<sup>e</sup> morning, Cromwell took
  Colonel Lindsey, his intimate friend, and first Capt. of his regiment, to
  a wood side not far from y<sup>e</sup> army, and bid him alight and
  follow him into that wood, &amp; take particular notice of what he saw
  &amp; heard.</p>

  <p>"After they had both alighted &amp; secured their horses, &amp; walked
  some small way into the wood, Lindsey began to turn pale, &amp; to be
  seiz'd with horrour, from some unknown cause; upon wch Cromwell askt him
  how he did, or how he felt himself. He answered, that he was in such a
  trembling &amp; consternation that he never felt y<sup>e</sup> like in
  all y<sup>e</sup> conflicts and battles he had been engaged in: But
  wether it proceeded from the gloomyness of y<sup>e</sup> place, or
  y<sup>e</sup> temperament of his body, he knew not. 'How now?' said
  Cromwell. 'What! trowbled with vapours? Come forward, man.' They had not
  gon above 20 yards before Lindsey on a sudden stood still and cry'd out,
  by all that's good he was seized with such unaccountable terrours &amp;
  astonishment that it was impossible for him to stir one step further.
  Upon which Cromwell call'd him faint-hearted fool, &amp; bid him stand
  there &amp; observe or be witness: and then advancing to some distance
  from him, he met with a grave elderly man, with a roll of parchment in
  his hand, who deliver'd it to Cromwell, who eagerly perused it. Lindsey,
  a little recover'd from his fear, heard severall loud words betwixt them:
  particularly Cromwell said, 'This is but for seven year. I was to have it
  for 21, and it must and shall be so.' The other told him positively it
  could not be for above seven; upon which Cromwell cry'd with a great
  fierceness, it shd be, however, for 14 year; but the other person plorily
  declared it could not possibly be for any longer time: and if he woud not
  take it so, there was others that woud accept of it: Upon which Cromwell
  at last took y<sup>e</sup> parchment, and returning to Lindsey with great
  joy in his countenance, he cry'd, 'Now, Lindsey, the battle's our own: I
  long to be engag'd.' Returning out of the wood, they rode to
  y<sup>e</sup> army. Cromwell with a resolution to engage as soon as
  possible, &amp; y<sup>e</sup> other with a design of leaving
  y<sup>e</sup> army as soon. After y<sup>e</sup> first charge Lindsey
  deserted his post, and rode away with all possible speed, day and night,
  till he came into y<sup>e</sup> county of Norfolk, to y<sup>e</sup> house
  of an intimate friend, and minister of that parish: Cromwell, as soon as
  he mist him, sent all ways after him, with a promise of a great reward to
  any that w'd bring him alive or dead.</p>

  <p>"Thus far y<sup>e</sup> narrative of Lindsey himself; but something
  further is to be remembered to complete &amp; confirm y<sup>e</sup>
  story.</p>

  <p>"When Mr. Thorowgood saw his friend Lindsey come into his yard, his
  horse and himself just tired, in a sort of amaze he said, 'How, now,
  Colonel; we hear there is like to be a battle shortly. What! fled from
  your colours?' 'A battle!' said y<sup>e</sup> other; 'yes, there has bin
  a battle, and I am sure y<sup>e</sup> King is beaten. If ever I strike a
  stroke for Cromwell again, may I perish eternally, for I am sure he has
  made a league with y<sup>e</sup> Devil, and he will have him in due
  time.' Then, desiring his protection from Cromwell's inquisitors, he went
  in &amp; related y<sup>e</sup> whole story, and all the circumstances,
  concluding with these remarkable words, That Cromwell w'd certainly die
  that day seven year that the battle was fought.</p>

  <p>"The strangeness of his relation caused Mr. Thorowgood to order his
  son John, then about 12 years of age, to write it in full length in his
  common place book, &amp; to take it from Lindsey's own mouth. This common
  place book, and likewise y<sup>e</sup> same story writen in other books,
  I am sure is still preserv'd in y<sup>e</sup> family of y<sup>e</sup>
  Thorowgoods: But how far Lindsey is to be believed, &amp; how far
  y<sup>e</sup> story is to be accounted incredible, is left to
  y<sup>e</sup> reader's faith and judgment, &amp; not to any determination
  of our own."</p>

<h2>Replies to Minor Queries.</h2>

  <p><i>Gig Hill</i> (Vol. iii., p. 222.).&mdash;Perhaps your correspondent
  is mistaken in saying that "there is no indication of anything in the
  land to warrant the name." At least, the very fact of its being a hill is
  suspicious. If I could venture to affront you with a pun, I should say,
  that it seems to me very natural that the <i>top</i> of a hill should
  look like a <i>gig</i>. Mercy on us! do words wear out so fast? Why, I
  have not reached three-score, and did not I "whip my gig" when I was an
  "infant"?&mdash;not an infant born in a remote province, sucking in
  archaism with my mother's milk, playing with heirloom toys, and calling
  them by obsolete names, but a smart little cockney, born and bred in the
  parish of St. Andrew, Holborn, where, no doubt, there were gig-whipping
  brats plenty. In the crowded state of your columns, you would not thank
  me for enlarging on the top-<i>hic</i>, or I should really feel disposed
  to enter into a dissertation on the nature and characteristic differences
  of whipping-tops, humming-tops, peg-tops, and gigs. As to the latter, it
  certainly occurs to me, now that the question is raised, that I have not
  seen such a thing for a long time; though I fancy <i>gigs</i> lying in
  the shop-windows, as they did at a period when I was more likely to
  observe them; and if they have become so far forgotten, it may be worth
  while, for the sake of Shakspeare, to say that they were generally (as
  far as I remember always) made of horn; and therefore, when Holofernes
  says "Go, whip thy gig" (which means just the same as Mr. Oldbuck's "Sew
  your sampler, monkey!"), Moth replies, "Lend me your <i>horn</i> to make
  one, and I will whip about your infamy <i>circum circa</i>; a gig of a
  cuckold's horn!" It is enough to add that the gig was made of the tip of
  the horn, and looked, while spinning, like an inverted extinguisher. It
  was hollow, but my impression is that there was sometimes lead at the
  bottom of the inside. Even with the ballast, it was a ticklish, volatile,
  kickety thing, much more difficult to set up and to keep up than the
  sober whipping-top, and bearing somewhat the same relation to one in bulk
  and motion, <!-- Page 284 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page284"></a>{284}</span>that a ship's gig may do to herself, or a
  gig on land to a coach. As to Gig Hill, however, unless it has a conical
  top, some other explanation must be sought.</p>

  omitted, was a Spanish priest, who renounced the Roman Catholic belief,
  and was imprisoned by the Inquisition, and after undergoing many
  sufferings made his escape to England in the latter part of the reign of
  Charles II. His history is contained in <i>An Account of his Life and

  Confession of Faith of James Salgado, a Spaniard, and sometimes a Priest
  in the Church of Rome</i>, London, 1681, 4to. Watt and Lowndes both
  notice some of his pieces, but their lists are very imperfect, and do not
  comprise the tract, of which your correspondent gives the title, and

  <p><i>The Mitre and the "Cloven Tongues"</i> (Vol. iii., p.
  146.).&mdash;My attention has just been directed to the remark of your
  correspondent L.&nbsp;M.&nbsp;M.&nbsp;R., who adduces the miracle of the "cloven tongues
  as of fire" as having supplied the form of the mitre.</p>

  <p>This is an old explanation; but your correspondent does not appear to
  be aware that "cloven" has been rejected by high classical authority, as
  not being a correct interpretation of the word <span
  title="diamerizomenai" class="grk"
  >&delta;&iota;&alpha;&mu;&epsilon;&rho;&iota;&zeta;&#x1F79;&mu;&epsilon;&nu;&alpha;&iota;</span>.
  The exact translation is, "And tongues as of fire appeared, being
  distributed to them." The same verb is used in the passage, "They
  <i>parted</i> my garments among them,"&mdash;parted or
  distributed&mdash;the exact equivalent.</p>

  <p>It appears to me that the translators have here made an extraordinary
  blunder. They have, I think, mistaken <span title="diamêrizô" class="grk"
  >&delta;&iota;&alpha;&mu;&eta;&rho;&#x1F77;&zeta;&omega;</span> for <span
  title="diamerizô" class="grk"
  >&delta;&iota;&alpha;&mu;&epsilon;&rho;&#x1F77;&zeta;&omega;</span>. For
  the peculiar meaning of the former verb I beg to refer those who have not
  observed it, to Liddell and Scott's <i>Lexicon</i>. The substitution of a
  letter here (<span class="grk">&eta;</span> for <span
  class="grk">&epsilon;</span>) would give to the Scripture term a
  significance, which, though analogous to that of the current translation,
  is immeasurably distant from the exact interpretation.</p>

  of inquiries by a committee appointed by the Court of Common Council in
  1764. <i>Mr. Peter Cunningham</i>, in the "London Occurrences" prefixed

  <p><i>Scandal against Queen Elizabeth</i> (Vol. ii., p. 393.; Vol. iii.,
  p. 11.).&mdash;In <i>Hubback on the Evidence of Succession</i>, p. 253,
  after some remarks on the word "natural," not of itself in former times
  denoting illegitimacy, this passage occurs:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"But as early as the time of Elizabeth the word <i>natural</i>,
  standing alone, had acquired something of its present meaning. The
  Parliament, in debating upon the act establishing the title to the crown
  in the Queen's issue, thought it proper to alter the words 'issue
  lawfully begotten,' into 'natural-born issue,' conceiving the latter to
  be a more delicate phrase. But this created a suspicion among the people,
  that the Queen's favourite, Leicester, intended after her death to set up
  some bastard of his own, pretending it was born of her, and bred up
  privately."&mdash;Duke of Buckingham <i>On Treasons</i>, cited Amos's

  <p><i>Origin of Harlequins</i> (Vol. iii., p. 165.).&mdash;Your
  correspondent and querist E.&nbsp;L.&nbsp;N. wishes for an account of the Origin of
  Harlequins. I beg to refer E.&nbsp;L.&nbsp;N. to an account of the Hellequines, or
  "La Mesnie Hellequin," given by M. Paul Paris, in his work on the
  <i>Manuscripts François de la Bib. du Roi</i>, vol. i. p. 322. M. Paris
  says:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"On donnoit ce nom (Hellequines) à des espèces de feux follets ou
  génies plutôt malfaisants que favorables, et plutôt moqueurs que
  malfaisants.... L'origine de la tradition de la Mesnie Hellequin se perd
  dans l'obscurité des temps. On l'entendoit surtout bruire dans les
  environs de la ville d'<i>Arles</i>.... J'ignore la première origine de
  cette locution; mais ce qui me semble incontestable, c'est qu'on
  confondit facilement la Mesnie Hellequin avec celle '<i>de la Mort</i>,'
  famille bariolée de rouge et de noir, et dont le manteau de cérémonie
  devoit être un grand pan de toile ou linceul. Déjà le lecteur a devancé
  la conséquence qu'il faut tirer de tout cela; la Mesnie Hellequin, partie
  nécessaire des cortéges effrayants ou grotesques dans le moyen-âge, est
  devenue insensiblement, sous la main des arrangeurs, notre <i>famille
  d'Arlequin</i>. Le costume bariolé d'Arlequin n'est rien autre que le
  fantastique costume du représentant de la Mort.... Et, si ce que je viens
  de dire est fondé, on ne répètera plus après Ménage (Gilles), que le mot
  <i>Arlequin</i> fut pris d'abord, sur la fin du <span
  class="scac">XVI</span> siècle, par un certain bouffon italien que le
  Président <i>Harlay</i> avoit accueilli. Il est certain que le mot
  <i>Arlequin</i> se trouve très-anciennement dans un grand nombre de
  mystères.</p>

  <p>"'Numquid me velis,' ecrivoit Jean Raulin, mort en 1514, 'antiquam
  illam familiam Harlequini, revocare, ut videatur mortuus inter mundanæ
  curiæ nebulas et caligines equitare?'"</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>By the above extracts, which I fear you will find too long,
  harlequinades would seem rather to be derived from the wanton pranks of
  sprites than the coarse gambols of buffoons; and this derivation would
  certainly best agree with the accepted character of the modern
  harlequin.</p>

  course, misprints for "variis" and "antevolat," apply with such peculiar
  exactness to Guido's celebrated Aurora, at the Rospigliosi Palace, that I
  cannot but think the painting has given rise to the lines. Besides, in
  the ancient mythology, the Horæ are said to be <i>three</i> in number,
  daughters of Jupiter and Themis, and one of their offices was harnessing
  the horses of the Sun. It is unlikely, therefore, that any classic author
  would mention them as being seven in number.</p>

  which is held on old St. Peter's Day, to whom the cathedral church is

  <p><i>Anticipations of Modern Ideas by Defoe</i> (Vol. iii., pp. 137.
  195.).&mdash;It is a singular fact, to which I do not remember a
  reference has hitherto been made, that Defoe, in his <i>Life and
  Adventures of Captain Singleton</i>, has foreshadowed the discovery by
  recent travellers of a great inland lake in the South of Africa. He
  describes his adventurous hero and companions, during their attempt to
  cross this vast continent from Mozambique to Angola, as having, on the
  ninth day of their journey, come in "view of a great lake of water."</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"The next day," he adds, "which was the tenth from our setting out, we
  came to the edge of this lake, and happily for us, we came to it at the
  south point of it, for to the north we could see no end of it; so we
  passed by it, and travelled three days by the side of it."&mdash;<i>Life,
  Adventures, and Piracies of Captain Singleton</i>, chap. vi.</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>According to a rough calculation by one of the party, they were, a few
  days before reaching it, 700 miles from the coast of Mozambique, and 1500
  from the Cape of Good Hope. Now Messrs. Murray and Oswell, the
  enterprising travellers to whom we owe the discovery of this vast South
  African lake, describe it as being in longitude 24° East, latitude 19°
  South; a position not very wide apart from that indicated in Defoe's
  amusing fiction.</p>

  <p><i>Lord Howard of Effingham</i> (Vol. iii., p. 244.).&mdash;I submit
  that the passages quoted by your correspondent are not sufficient
  evidence to lead us to conclude that that nobleman <i>ever</i> was a
  Protestant. As to the "neglect of reverence to the Holy Sacrament," it is
  only said that the priests might pretend <i>that</i> as a cause; and it
  is not to be supposed that an ambassador would so far forget himself as
  to show any disrespect to the religion of the <!-- Page 288 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page288"></a>{288}</span>prince he was sent to.
  Besides, it is likely that Lord Howard was chosen for the embassy as
  being a Catholic, and therefore more acceptable to a prince of the same
  religion.</p>

  <p>2nd. Fuller's words only refer to testimony on a disputed fact, on
  which Catholic evidence the effect quoted by him would have peculiar
  weight.</p>

  <p>3rd. The words to Garnet, who had declared his innocence and
  abhorrence of the imputed crime, are such as a Catholic would be most
  likely to use.</p>

  <p>4th. The word "<i>our</i>," in the royal instructions, is the word of
  form, and resembles the editorial "<i>we</i>." In royal instructions to
  Mr. Shiel at Florence, Mr. Wyse at Naples, or Mr. More O'Ferrall at
  Malta, her Majesty would use the words "our religion;" would that imply
  that any or all of those gentlemen were Protestants?</p>

  <p>After all, Lord Howard may have conformed to the court religion after
  the period of the Armada: occasional conformity was frequent at the
  period.</p>

  Covington, Huntingdonshire, where a few of the old open seats remain
  towards the western end, in which each sex still sits on its proper side,
  although the custom does not hold with respect to the pews which some of

  <p><i>Separation of the Sexes at Church.</i>&mdash;Many of your

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"But also in the two severall vawtes or towmbes in the sayd chappell,

  <p><i>Vox Populi Vox Dei</i> (Vol. i., p. 370.).&mdash;Your correspondent
  <span class="sc">Daniel Rock</span> states these words to have been
  chosen by the Archbishop of Canterbury, Simon Mepham, as his text for the
  sermon he preached when Edward III. was called to the throne; and in your
  Notices to Correspondents, Vol. iii., p. 254., you repeat the
  statement.</p>

  <p>The prelate by whom the sermon was preached was not Simon Mepham, but
  his predecessor, Walter Reynolds, who was Archbishop of Canterbury when
  the second Edward was deposed, and when Edward III. was crowned, on
  February 1, 1327. This Walter Reynolds died on November 16, 1327, and
  Simon Mepham was appointed his successor on December 11, 1327. John
  Toland, in his <i>Anglia Libera</i>, p. 114., has this reference to the
  sermon which was preached by the Archbishop Reynolds on the occasion of
  the king's coronation:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"To Edward I. succeeded his son Edward II., who growing an intolerable
  tyrant, was in a parliament summoned by himself formally accused of
  misgovernment, and on his own acknowledging the truth of this charge,
  solemnly deposed. When his son, Edward III., was elected with universal
  consent, Walter, the Archbishop of Canterbury, preached the coronation
  sermon, and took these words for his text, "<i>Vox populi Vox Dei</i>,
  the voice of the people is the voice of God,"&mdash;so little did they
  dream in those days of the divine right of monarchy, or that all power
  did not originally derive from the people, for whom and by whom all
  governments are erected and maintained."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>Sir Harris Nicolas in his <i>Synopsis of the Peerage,</i> and Dugdale
  in his <i>Monasticon</i>, give the name of this Archbishop as Walter
  Reynolds. Sir Richard Baker, in his <i>Chronicle</i>, describes him as
  Walter Reginald; and in Hume's <i>England</i> he is called Walter de
  Reynel.</p>

  <p><i>Mazer Wood</i> (Vol. iii., p. 239.).&mdash;The Querist asks, "Has

  <p>It is used to signify a cup. Vide Walter Scott's <i>Lord of the
  Isles</i>, where Robert Bruce is speaking:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"Bring here, he said, the Mazers four,</p>
      <p>My noble fathers loved of yore."</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>And it is probably derived from the Irish "Maeddher," a standing cup,
  generally of <i>wood</i>, of a quadrangular form, with a handle on each
  of the sides. The puzzle was how to drink out of it, which was done from
  the angles. A silver "Maeddher" was presented to Lord Townshend when
  leaving Ireland, who puzzled many of his English friends by placing it
  before them filled with claret. Uninitiated persons usually attempted to
  drink from the flat side, and poured the wine over their clothes. I think
  another was presented to Lord Normanby when in Ireland. We see <i>gutta
  percha</i> <!-- Page 289 --><span class="pagenum"><a

  <p><i>Traditions from remote Periods through few Hands</i> (Vol. iii., p.
  237.).&mdash;The following facts may not be uninteresting on this
  subject.</p>

  <p>The late Maurice O'Connell of Derrynane, co. Kerry, died early in
  1825, and would have completed 99 years on the 31st of March in that
  year. The writer hereof has heard him tell anecdotes derived from the
  conversation of Daniel M<sup>c</sup>Carthy, of the same co., who died
  about 1740, aged at least 108 years. This Daniel M<sup>c</sup>Carthy was
  commonly known by the nick-name of "Dhonald Bhin," or "Yellow Dan," and
  was the first man that ran away from the battle of Aughrim. There is a
  short account of him in Smith's <i>History of Kerry</i>, in which he is
  mentioned as lately deceased. You have thus a period of over 200 years,
  the traditions of which might be derived through three persons, the
  survivor of whom, your correspondent, is but middle aged. I remember
  being told in the co. Clare, circiter 1828, of an individual then lately
  deceased, who remembered the siege of Limerick by General Ginkle, and the
  news of the celebrated treaty of Limerick. It is to be wished that your
  readers who reside in, or may visit Ireland, would take an interest in
  this subject. I am certain that in remote parts of the country much
  curious tradition could be thus brought to light; and it would be
  interesting to compare the accounts of great public events, as remembered
  and handed down by the peasantry, with those which we take on the faith
  of historians.</p>

  <p>As relating to this subject, I may refer to the allusion made in page
  250. of the same Number to the Countess of Desmond, who was said to have

  Glanlearne in Valencia, the seat of the knight of Kerry; and it must have

  Elizabeth. Some record of how this old lady's jointure was provided for
  might yet be discovered, and the period of her decease thus

  <p><i>Latin Epigram on the Duchess of Eboli</i> (Vol. iii., p.
  208.).&mdash;This beautiful epigram, which C.&nbsp;R.&nbsp;H. has somewhat
  mutilated even in the two lines which he gives of it, was written by
  Jerome Amaltheus, who died in 1574, the year in which Henry III. of
  France came to the throne; so that it is unlikely at least that the
  "Amor" was meant for Mangirow, his "minion." In the edition of the poems
  of the three brothers Amalthei, which I possess, and which was printed at
  Amsterdam in 1689, the epigram runs&mdash;</p>

  <p><i>Symbolism of the Fir-cone</i> (Vol. i., p. 247.).&mdash;The
  Fir-cone on the Thyrsus&mdash;a practice very general throughout Greece,
  but which is very prevalent at Athens, may perhaps, in some degree,
  account for the connexion of the Fir-cone (surmounting the Thyrsus) with
  the worship of Bacchus. Incisions are made in the fir-trees for the
  purpose of obtaining the turpentine, which distils copiously from the
  wound. This juice is mixed with the new wine in large quantities; the
  Greeks supposing that it would be impossible to keep it any length of
  time without this mixture. The wine has in consequence a very peculiar
  taste, but is by no means unpleasant after a little use. This, as we
  learn from Plutarch, was an ancient custom (<i>Sympos. Quæst.</i> iii.
  and iv. p. 528. edn. Wytten); the Athenians, therefore, might naturally
  have placed the Fir-cone in the hands of Bacchus. ("Lord Aberdeen's

  children of the inhabitants of that parish gratis, to read, write, and
  cast accounts, and in Latin, Greek, and Hebrew, as occasion should
  require; and that he had erected six almshouses at Drax, for six aged and
  impotent people at that parish, and the lodgment of six poor boys; and
  for the support and maintenance of the said school, master, alms people,
  and poor boys, he directed his executors to lay out 2000<i>l.</i> in <!--

  purchase of freehold land of 120<i>l.</i> per annum in or near Drax, to

  <p>At the time of the inquiry by the charity commissioners, the estates

  391 acres of land, let at 542<i>l.</i> per annum, and there was an

  city. Although he makes John the first to break through the superstition,
  yet the same is attributed to his predecessor Stephen, who is described
  by H. Huntingdon as entering the city fearlessly&mdash;"prohibentibus
  quibusdam superstitiosis." This was after the great disasters of
  Stephen's reign; but as the succession eventually departed from his line,
  Lord Lyttleton observes that the citizens might nevertheless be
  strengthened in their credulity; and Henry II. certainly humoured it so
  far as to wear his crown only in the suburb of Wigford. John seems to
  have been very partial to the place, and visited it repeatedly, as did
  many of his successors. Many parallel superstitions might, no doubt, be
  gathered, as that of Oxford, and Alexander the Great at Babylon,

  <p><i>Haybands in Seals</i> (Vol. iii., p. 186.).&mdash;In your paper for
  March 8. I observe a Query by <span class="sc">Mr. M.&nbsp;A. Lower</span>
  respecting seals. It appears that <span class="sc">Mr. Lower</span> has
  in his possession one or two seals, temp. Henry VII., which are impressed
  on haybands, that is to say, the wax is encircled by a twisted wisp of
  hay, or split straw; and, if I rightly understand <span class="sc">Mr.
  Lower</span>, no device is apparent on the wax, but some ends of the hay
  or straw protrude from the surface of it. Under these circumstances <span
  class="sc">Mr. Lower</span> states his opinion that such seals belonged
  to mediæval gentlemen who occupied their time in fattening
  stock,&mdash;simply graziers.</p>

  <p>It may be interesting to some of your correspondents, and especially
  to <span class="sc">Mr. Lower</span>, to know that a few seals, both
  pendent and impressed on the parchment itself, within haybands, may be
  found of as early a date as the reign of Edward II. From that time the
  fashion become very prevalent: in the reigns of Richard II., Henry IV.,
  Henry V., Henry VI., and, indeed, down to the period of Elizabeth, it was
  the common practice to secure the wax impression in this manner. Almost
  all the impressions of the Privy Seal of Henry V., called "the Eagle,"
  are made on haybands. It is needless to give further examples, as they
  must be well known to all antiquaries who have studied the history of
  seals. It is not from the examination of a few specimens of early seals
  that a general conclusion is to be rationally drawn; and it is to be
  hoped that <span class="sc">Mr. Lower</span> may, even yet, be induced to
  abandon his singular theory of graziers' seals.</p>

  fac-simile representation of a letter upon paper from James IV. of
  Scotland to Henry VII., dated July 12, 1502, showing the seal encircled
  by a rush ring. At page cxxxvii. it is stated that in the fifteenth
  century a rush ring surrounding the fragile wax was not unfrequently used
  for the purpose of preserving it.</p>

  <p><i>Aver</i> (Vol. iii., pp. 42. 157.).&mdash;Spelman, in his
  <i>Glossary</i>, derives <i>averia</i> from <i>averare</i> pro laborare.
  <i>Averare</i> he derives from the French <i>ouvre</i> and
  <i>ouvrage</i>, "vel potius a Latino <i>operare</i>, <i>o</i> et
  <i>p</i>, ut solent, in <i>a</i> et <i>u</i>, conversis." "Hence," he
  says, "our ancestors called beasts of burden <i>averia</i>, and the
  Scotch called them <i>avaria</i>." In Northumberland, he elsewhere adds,
  "they call a lazy, sluggish horse 'a faulse aver,' or 'afer.'"</p>

  <p><i>Averum</i> signified goods and chattels, and personal property in
  general, and, in this sense, is derived from the French <i>avoir</i>. It
  also signified the royal treasure, as appears from the following extract
  front the will of Philip Augustus, sub anno <!-- Page 292 --><span

  <p>"<i>The Sword Flamberg</i>" (Vol. iii., p. 168.)&mdash;<span
  class="sc">An English Mother</span> is informed that "Flamberge," or
  "Floberge," is the name of the sword won in battle from the Saracen
  admiral Anthenor by Mangis d'Aygremont, the hero of the romance of that
  name. Ancient swords were frequently "flamboyant," or with waved edges;
  more especially those used for purposes of state. The Dukes of Burgundy
  bore a two-handed sword of this form. Indeed, "flaming swords," as they
  were called, were worn down to the time of our Charles II., and perhaps
  later. It is rather singular that the ordinary synonyma for a sword
  should be "brand." The name of the weapon taken from King Bucar by the
  Cid was "Tizona," or the Fire-brand.</p>

  <p>The flamboyant type may possibly be of Eastern origin. The krisses of
  the Malays, at the present day have serpentine blades.</p>

  <p><i>Cockade</i> (Vol. iii., pp. 7. 196.).&mdash;The <i>cockade</i> was
  simply the knot of the riband that served to <i>cock</i> the broad
  flapped hat worn by military men in the seventeenth century, and which in
  fine weather, or going into action, &amp;c., they used to <i>cock</i>, by
  means of hooks, laces, and ribands. We see still in the <!-- Page 293
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page293"></a>{293}</span>cocked-hats of
  coachmen and beadles, the traces of these old ligaments. Hence the phrase
  to <i>cock one's hat</i>. Let me add one or two remarks on other points
  of dress arising out of old military habits. In old times coats were of
  the shape we now call frocks, and <i>lined</i> throughout, generally with
  a different colour from the outside. When a person in one of these coats
  was going about any active work, and particularly into fight, he doubled
  back his sleeves, and folded back the collar, which, being of a different
  colour, came to be what we now call the <i>facings</i> of military
  uniforms. The French, truer to their origin, still call them the
  "<i>revers</i>." So also on such occasions the broad skirts of the frock
  coat used to be hooked back not to impede the movements of the lower
  limbs, and thence the swallow tails of military uniforms. So also the
  high jack-boots, that covered the knees, used, in walking, to be turned
  down, and the inside being of a lighter colour, gave the idea of what are
  called <i>top-boots</i>.</p>

<h3>NOTES ON BOOKS, SALES, CATALOGUES, ETC.</h3>

  <p>In the belief that the time has arrived when the history of our
  national architecture must be reconsidered, with a view to a revision of
  the classes or periods into which it has hitherto been divided, Mr.
  Sharpe has just put forth a handsomely illustrated volume, under the
  title of <i>The Seven Periods of English Architecture defined and
  illustrated</i>. Mr. Sharpe's proposal is, that these seven periods
  should be thus formed:&mdash;three belonging to the division
  <i>Romanesque</i>, under the titles of Saxon, Norman, and Transitional
  Periods; and the remaining four to the <i>Gothic</i>, viz. the Lancet,
  Geometrical, Curvilinear, and Rectangular Periods. We must, of course,
  refer our readers who desire to know the principles upon which Mr. Sharpe
  proposes this great change to the work itself, which is plain and to the
  purpose.</p>

  <p>Mr. Bohn some time since became the purchaser of a large number of the
  copper-plates of Gillray's <i>Caricatures</i>. Having had impressions
  taken, and arranged them in one large volume, he sought the assistance of
  Mr. Wright, who had just then published his <i>History of the House of
  Hanover, illustrated by Caricatures</i>, and Mr. R.&nbsp;H. Evans, the
  well-known bibliopole, towards an anecdotical catalogue of the works of
  this clever satirist: and the result of the labours of these gentlemen
  has just been published under the title of <i>Historical and Descriptive
  Account of the Caricatures of James Gillray, comprising a Political and
  Humorous History of the latter Part of the Reign of George III.</i> The
  volume will be found not only an interesting key to Mr. Bohn's edition of
  Gillray, and a guide to those who may be making a separate collection of
  his works, but a pleasant illustration of the wit and satire which lashed
  the politicians and amused the public</p>

  <p>Those who know the value of those historical researches which Sir F.
  Palgrave has already given to the world, will be glad to hear that the
  first volume of his <i>History of Normandy and of England</i> will
  probably be published before the close of the present month. In this
  first volume, which is described in the advertisement as containing the
  general relations of Mediæval Europe, the Carlovingian Empire, and the
  Danish Expeditions into Gaul, we understand the learned author has
  treated those expeditions at considerable length, and enters very fully
  into that of the decline of the Carlovingian Empire,&mdash;a portion of
  the work as important, as it is in a great measure new, to the English
  reader. Not the least valuable part of the book will be Sir Francis
  Palgrave's account of the nature and character of the Continental
  Chronicles, which form the substratum of his work, but which, existing
  only in the great collections of Duchesne, Bouquet, Pertz, &amp;c., are
  generally very imperfectly known to English students.</p>

  <p>Messrs. Sotheby and Wilkinson will sell, on Monday next, a collection
  of very rare and interesting Autograph Letters, more particularly
  illustrative of the period of the Civil Wars. On the same day they will
  also commence a Four-days' Sale of valuable Books, and Books of
  Engravings, chiefly from the library of a gentleman deceased, including
  the original edition of Stuart and Revett's <i>Athens</i>, a copy of
  Merian's <i>Topographia Germaniæ</i> containing nearly one thousand
  engravings, and many other works of high character.</p>

  <p><span class="sc">Books Received</span>.&mdash;<i>Boswell's Life of
  Johnson, Illustrated</i>, vol. i. This is the first volume of the
  <i>National Illustrated Library</i>, which the projectors describe "as an
  endeavour to bestow upon half-crown volumes for the <i>many</i> the same
  typographical accuracy, and the same artistic ability, hitherto almost
  exclusively devoted to high-priced books for the <i>few</i>." In choosing
  <i>Boswell's Johnson</i> for their first work, the projectors have shown
  excellent judgment; and we are bound to add that the book is not only
  well selected, but neatly printed, and illustrated with a number of
  excellent woodcuts.&mdash;<i>Illustrations of Medieval Costume in
  England, &amp;c.</i>, Part II. This second part deserves the same praise
  for cheapness as its predecessor.&mdash;<i>The Cape and the Kafirs</i>,
  the new volume of Bohn's cheap series, is a well-timed reprint of Mrs.
  Ward's <i>Five Years in Kafirland</i>, with some little alteration and
  abridgment, and the addition of some information for intending emigrants,
  from information supplied by published official reports.</p>

  <p>"A work in which a subject of great historical importance is treated
  with the care, diligence, and learning it deserves; in which Mr. Foss has
  brought to light many points previously unknown, corrected many errors,
  and shown such ample knowledge of his subject as to conduct it
  successfully through all the intricacies of a difficult investigation;
  and such taste and judgment as will enable him to quit, when occasion
  requires, the dry details of a professional inquiry, and to impart to his
  work as he proceeds, the grace and dignity of a philosophical
  history."&mdash;<i>Gent. Mag.</i></p>

  <p>THE GREEK CHURCH; a Sketch. By the Author of "Proposals for Christian
  Union."</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"Anything written by the Author of 'Proposals for Christian Union' is
  sure to be distinguished by an excellent spirit. The 'Greek Church,' a
  Sketch, is well put together; and, though slight, will be found to
  contain as much real information as many a book of greater size and more
  pretension."&mdash;<i>The Guardian.</i></p>

  <p>A SUPPLEMENT ON THE DOCTRINE AND DISCIPLINE OF THE GREEK CHURCH.</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"We characterised the interesting little volume entitled 'The Greek
  Church' as historical rather than doctrinal. The title of this Supplement
  shows that it expressly supplies the very material in which the original
  work was deficient."&mdash;<i>Notes and Queries.</i></p>
